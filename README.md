# PhoenixJsroutes

![build](https://travis-ci.org/tiagoengel/phoenix-jsroutes.svg?branch=master)

Brings phoenix router helpers to your javascript code.

This project consist of a mix compiler task that generates a javascript
module containing helpers to access your server routes.

## Installation

Add the latest version to your ```mix.exs``` file:
```elixir
def deps do
  [{:phoenix_jsroutes, "~> 0.0.4"}]
end
```

## Getting started

Add the ```jsroutes``` compiler to the list of compilers in your project.

```elixir
def project do
    [app: :jsroutes_test,
    ...
    compilers: [:phoenix, :gettext] ++ Mix.compilers ++ [:jsroutes]
    ...]
end
```
**This compiler should be placed after the elixir compiler, this is important because your router module should be already compiled when this compiler runs**

After that, if you run ```mix compile``` the file ```web/static/js/phoenix-jsroutes.js```
will be generated.

You can clean up the generated file by running the ```mix clean```.

### Using the javascript helpers
The code generated by this compiler is compatible with AMD, Commonjs and Global builds.

The functions are generated with different names from the ones in the server in order to follow javascript best practices. For example:

	user_path(:index)                => userIndex()
	user_path(:create)               => userCreate()
	user_path(:update, 1)            => userUpdate(1)
	user_friends_path(:update, 1, 2) => userFriendsUpdate(1, 2)


If you are using the default phoenix configuration with ```brunchjs``` (or any other commonjs compatible build tool like webpack and browserify) you can use the helpers like this

```javascript
import routes from './phoenix-jsroutes'
routes.userIndex(); // /users
routes.userCreate(); // /users
routes.userUpdate(1); // /users/1
routes.userFriendsUpdate(1, 2); // /users/1/friends/2
```

You can also import only the routes you need

```javascript
import { userIndex, userUpdate } from './phoenix-jsroutes';
userIndex();
userUpdate(1);
```

For AMD builds
```javascript
require(['phoenix-jsroutes'], routes => {
  routes.userIndex();
})
```

For Global builds
```javascript
PhoenixJsRoutes.userIndex();
// If the name conflicts with anything...
var myBeautifulName = PhoenixJsRoutes.noConflict();
```

## Live reload

If you want the javascript module to be generated automatically when your router changes, just add this compiler to the list of ```reloadable compilers```.

```elixir
# config/dev.exs

config :my_app, MyApp.Endpoint,
  http: [port: 4000],
  ...
  reloadable_compilers: [:gettext, :phoenix, :elixir, :jsroutes]
```

## Configuration

Key | Type | Default | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
output_folder | String | web/static/js | Sets the folder used to generate files
include | Regex | nil | Will include only routes matching this regex
exclude | Regex | nil | Will include only routes not matching this regex

Configurations should be added to the key ```:jsroutes``` in your application.
```elixir
config :my_app, :jsroutes,
  output_folder: "priv/static/js",
  include: ~r[/api],
  exclude: ~r[/admin]
```
